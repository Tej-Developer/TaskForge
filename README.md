## 📌 About The Project

**TaskForge** is a task-management web application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It allows users to **sign up**, **log in**, and manage their tasks through a clean dashboard UI. The app uses browser session storage, so data is temporary and resets when the tab is closed.

This project is ideal for beginners learning client-side logic, DOM manipulation, and UI interactions without a backend.

## ✨ Features

✔️ User Authentication (Login / Signup)  
✔ Add and view tasks  
✔ Simple and clean dashboard UI  
✔ Tasks managed within the session (clears on tab close)  
✔ Client-side JavaScript logic
